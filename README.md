#### _This application will calculate the user's age on different planets of our solar system, June 26th, 2020_

#### By _**Thomas Glenn**_

## Description

__As a code review test for the Epicodus coding school we are to create a program which determines the age of a person living on a different planet. A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. (ex. A solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days). 

| Spec   |     Input     |  Output | Test |
|----------|:-------------:|------:| ------:|
| The program will take in a user's age and life expectancy and planet |  "43" "81" "earth" | None | Passed   |
| The program will calculate user's Earth age in Earth days divided by Orbital Period (Days) |  "43 x 365/365" |  "43" |    Passed    |
| The program will calculate user's age in Mercury years | "43" |  "160" |       |
